# This is the default webserv configuration file,
# Use it as a template to create your own,

### --- STANDARDS --- ###
# Config is case-sensitive
# It is prohibited to comment a "location [ ]"
# Usage of ';' is prohibited at the end of line.
# Always use '=' to differentiate from keys and values.
# If multiple values:
#   - Whole line after '=' is stored on an std::string,
#   - Use the public method split( std::string, char ) to generate a vector.
#   - NB : Most cases the delimitor will be a WS ' ' or a COMMA ','.
