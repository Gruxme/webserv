# This is the default webserv configuration file,
# Use it as a template to create your own,

### TO-DO {aabounak}
# 1 - CONFIG FILE STILL DOESN'T THROW EXCEPTIONS AND ERRORS IN CASE OF AN INVALID CONFIG FILE.

### --- STANDARDS --- ###
# Config is case-sensitive and order reliable.
# Any line that contains a '#' at the beggining will considered as a comment.
# Any line that contains a '#' not at the beggining will be considered a parsing error.
# Usage of ';' is prohibited at the end of line.
# Always use '=' to differentiate from keys and values.
# If multiple values:
#   - Whole line after '=' is stored on an std::string,
#   - Use the public method split( std::string, char ) to generate a vector.
#   - NB : Most cases the delimitor will be a WS ' '.
